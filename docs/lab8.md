# Lab 8 (Stunts!)

## Task A (Flip)

The objective of task A was to drive my car at a wall, get it to flip 180 degrees in the air and then drive back. I did this using open loop control. This task requires driving the car very quickly at a wall, and changing direction fast enough 1 ft away from the wall that the car flips over and then drives back. In order to do this, several physical changes needed to happen to the car. First, I taped some end mills together and duct taped them to the front of my chasis. This moved the center of mass way up to the front of the robot and made pivoting on that axis way easier. Also, Kelvin and Tyler were kind enough to improvise the rubber mat and foam wall  with duct tape and cardboard boxes. I ended up improving the set up a bit by adding weight to the cardboard boxes so they didn't move. I started my car at around the 70 inch mark which is almost 2 meters.  

Here is a photo of the set up:
